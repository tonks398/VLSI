# SMT

##Requirements

pip install z3

pip install z3-solver

pip install matplotlib

pip install tqdm

##Run from Command Prompt

Please run the project from the src folder 'Jabbour\SMT\src'

To run the normal model:

python smt_norot

To run the rotated model:

python smt_rot

##Note

I saved my results in the folders 'rot-RJ' and 'norot-RJ' and left the folder 'rot' and 'no-rot' empty so that my outputs would not be overwritten when the models are run again.
